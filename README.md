Publication-quality infrared spectra with both micron and wavenumber x-axes.

This project presents snippets of code to produce publication quality figures displaying FTIR spectral data with both microns (wavelength) and wavenumbers given on the x-axis, making your data accessible to a broader range of scientists.

The programs are written for data files in dpt format, in wavenumber vs intensity format, but can easily take any input readable by numpy.loadtxt(). 

figure_sample.py is the final code snippet, producing a figure showing a single spectrum with microns on the bottom and wavenumbers across the top.

figure1_v3.py is a more complex plotting problem, involving series of spectrum stored in separate folders.

figure1_v1.py and figure1_v2.py are preliminary drafts, and need not be referred to.
